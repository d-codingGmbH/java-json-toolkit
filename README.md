# java-json-toolkit

The json-toolkit repository contains the code to the following libraries:
* `json-toolkit-text`: basic library for conversion between textual representations and special Java classes
* `json-toolkit-java` (available soon)

## json-toolkit-text

The json-toolkit-text library can be used to convert textual representations of JSON values into Java objects and to convert those Java objects into textual representations. The conversion into the textual version can use a configurable formatter to create texts that are more easy to read by humans.
